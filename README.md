## Projects

### 1. Nike Shoes (HTML+CSS+JS on JS components)
Mobile-first approach.
For this project, I aimed to gain a deeper understanding of how frameworks like Svelte and Vue function, which led me to use custom JS components. However, in general, I tend to prefer popular frameworks like Vue, React, and Svelte.

### 2. Geo App (HTML+CSS+JS)
I completed this task using only basic programming skills and my searching abilities. It was quite a challenging experience for me as I hadn't been acquainted with such technologies before.
