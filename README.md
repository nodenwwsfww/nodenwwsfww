### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My project and their links

## Projects

### 1. Nike Shoes (HTML+CSS+JS on JS components)
Mobile-first approach.
For this project, I set out to gain a deeper understanding of how modern frameworks like React and Vue work under the hood. To achieve this, I built the entire application without using any frameworks, relying solely on custom JavaScript functions and a self-implemented rendering system.
